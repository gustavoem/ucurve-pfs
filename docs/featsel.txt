       ffeeaattsseell receives a set SS of objects, values  associated  with  each  of
       them, a cost function cc with subsets of S as domain and real numbers as
       image, and searches for a subset X in S such as c(X) is minimum  (i.e.,
       there  are  no  Y in S, such as c(Y) < c(X)).  The minima subsets found
       are printed into the standard output.

       -a algorithm-name
              Selects the _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m_-_n_a_m_e as the algorithm used in the  search.
              The default value is _u_b_b (U-curve Branch and Bound); other valid
              names are _b_f_s (Best-First Search), _e_s (Exhaustive Search), _r_c (a
              Random  Chain  of  the  search space), _s_b_f_s (Sequential Backward
              Floating Selection), _s_b_s (Sequential Backward  Selection),  _s_f_f_s
              (Sequential Forward Floating Selection), _s_f_s (Sequential Forward
              Selection), _s_p_e_c___c_m_i (SPEC-CMI), and _u_c_s (U-Curve-Search).


       -c cost-function-name
              Selects the _c_o_s_t_-_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e  as  the  cost  function  of  the
              search.  The  default value is _s_u_b_s_e_t___s_u_m_; (polynomial reduction
              from the subset sum problem); other valid names are _a_b_d  (Atash-
              paz-Gargari, Braga-Neto, Dougherty), _c_f_s (Correlation-based Fea-
              ture Selection), _c_m_i (Conditional Mutual Information),  _e_x_p_l_i_c_i_t
              (cost  function  values  explicitly  defined  from  file),  _h_a_m_-
              _m_i_n_g___d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e_, (the Hamming  distance),  _m_c_e  (Mean  Conditional
              Entropy),  _m_i  (Mutual Information), and _c_m_i (Conditional Mutual
              Information), _p_o_i_n_t (constant cost function except for a  single
              element of mininum cost), and _t_a_i_l_o_r (computes a convex hull for
              subsets of an instance of the Tailor problem).


       -f input-file-name
              Uses as instance either a XML or  a  DAT  file  _i_n_p_u_t_-_f_i_l_e_-_n_a_m_e_,
              containing the elements of the set, their names and values.

       -h     Displays this help screen.

       -m number-of-minima
              The  number  of  minima  to be showed in the standard output. It
              should be and integer grater than zero, and the default value is
              1.

       -n number-of-elements
              If  the option -n is not used, featsel creates a random set with
              _n_u_m_b_e_r_-_o_f_-_e_l_e_m_e_n_t_s elements with a single value. It should be an
              integer greater than zero. The default value is 3.

       -l number-of-labels
              If  the option -l is not used and the input is a .DAT file, then
              featsel assumes that the instance has 2 labels.

       -r range
              If the option -f is not used, creates the elements of the random
              set with a single value greater or equal than zero and less than
              _r_a_n_g_e_.  The default value is 1000.

       -s     Stores all the visited subsets into the file called _v_i_s_i_t_e_d_._l_o_g

       -t max-number-of-calls-of-cost-function
              Set a _m_a_x_-_n_u_m_b_e_r_-_o_f_-_c_a_l_l_s_-_o_f_-_c_o_s_t_-_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_, a threshold value to
              end  the  execution if the cost function is computed that number
              of times.

       _e_t_c_/_f_e_a_t_s_e_l_._c_o_n_f
              The program configuration file (not implemented yet).
       _e_t_c_/_c_o_s_t_f_u_n_c_._c_o_n_f
              Configuration of the cost  function  lexical/syntactic  analyzer
              (not implemented yet).

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       PATH   May  be  useful  to add the full pathname of the directory where
              the featsel binary is located. The configuration files  must  be
              at the same directory of the binary.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:
       Bad magic number.
              The input file does not look like a XML file.
       Bad cost.
              ccoosstt--ffuunnccttiioonn--nnaammee given is not a valid one.

       XML parsing should be improved.
